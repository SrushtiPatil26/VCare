<h2>Vcare Day Care Chemotherapy Centre</h2>
<p>Vcare Day Care Chemotherapy Centre is a well-equipped chemotherapy clinic. Day care chemotherapy allows patients to walk home the same day of chemotherapy infusion; this saves both time and resources for patients.</p>
<p>Day care chemotherapy is one of the novel concepts in cancer care. Vcare is one of the first cancer hospitals to understand its importance and make it accessible to the patients. In many cases, chemotherapy patients do not even require a bed; they can receive treatment on a private couch or in the common lounge while reading, watching television or scrolling on their phones.</p>
<p>As a full-fledged and specialised Day Care Chemotherapy Centre, it has a 360-degree approach towards promoting wellness among patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p>
<p>At our Day Care Chemotherapy Centre, patients can consult skilled and experienced medical oncologists in an ambient treatment setting. Our cancer care team here also consists of specialised onconurses and RMOs.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>1. Right Information and the Best Treatment</h3>
<p>The medical oncologists at our Day Care Chemotherapy Centre will have several discussions with the patients and their caregivers to provide sufficient information about the treatment, possible after-effects and follow-ups.</p>
<p>Through our skilled expertise and personalised treatment plans, we focus on delivering the right treatment, the first time.</p>
<h3>2. Comfortable Treatment Setting</h3>
<p>Vcare’s Day Care Chemotherapy Centre is a one-of-a-kind treatment facility with spacious and comforting treatment and waiting areas. Every patient’s chemotherapy sessions are well planned. They are assigned a bed/recliner as soon as they walk into the centre.</p>
<h3>3. Care and Support by Specialised Onconurses</h3>
<p>Onconurses are specialised nurses who are skilled in taking care of cancer patients. These nurses are fully aware of the suffering and discomfort experienced by cancer patients and are trained to provide extra care and attention during these challenging times.</p>
<h3>4. Majority Would Not Require an Overnight Stay</h3>
<p>At the Day Care Chemotherapy Centre, patients can receive their treatment and leave for their home on the same day. In recent times, specialists are able to deliver chemotherapy in such a way that it is more convenient and less daunting for the patients.</p>
<p>This centre is also capable of delivering novel therapies in oncology, such as immunotherapy and hormonal therapy.</p>
<h3>5. A Dedicated Cytotoxic Drug Mixing Cabinet</h3>
<p>Vcare’s Day Care Chemotherapy Centre has a dedicated cytotoxic drug mixing cabinet to prevent spillage and contaminations during the mixing and ensure safe administration of chemotherapy drugs.</p>
<h3>6. Onco Diagnostics</h3>
<p>Apart from chemotherapy, our Day Care Chemotherapy Centre also houses an onco-diagnostic lab that offers all major diagnostic modalities from blood tests to biopsies.</p>

<h2>Why Visit Vcare Day Care Chemotherapy Centre?</h2>
<h3>1. Minimal Disruption to the Routine</h3>
<p>Each session may take between 1-8 hours depending upon the treatment plan devised, and the patients may leave once the session is over. This way, the routine activities of the patients are not hampered.</p>
<h3>2. Reduced Travelling Burdens</h3>
<p>Our Day Care Centre could reduce the travelling burdens for patients, who visit far-off hospitals for their chemotherapy sessions. With the care made available closer to their home, patients can comfortably attend their treatment sessions.</p>
<h3>3. Hassle-Free and Less Time-Consuming</h3>
<p>Since our Day Care Centre focuses only on chemotherapy or other medical oncology sub-specialities, such as hormone therapy and immunotherapy. The entire procedure, from registration to discharge, is made hassle-free, flexible and time-saving.</p>
<h3>4. Reduced Financial Burdens</h3>
<p>By delivering the treatment on an outpatient/day care basis and bringing care closer to home, our Day Care Centre makes cancer treatment more economical and less taxing for the patients.</p>
<h3>5. Reduced Risk of Hospital-Acquired Infections</h3>
<p>Chemotherapy patients, in most cases, are immune-compromised. Despite infection control protocols in place, hospitals are associated with certain infection risks, which could be due to the large influx of patients, availability of treatment for various health problems, etc. However, this is not the case at Day Care Centre, since it only caters to chemotherapy patients and follows strict hygienic practices.</p>
<h3>6. Faster Recovery</h3>
<p>Cancer patients can recover well in the comfort of their home. Having the near and dear ones around can positively impact the patient’s outlook towards the disease and treatment. This positive outlook supports better treatment response and faster recovery.</p>
